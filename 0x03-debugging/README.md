Fix errors in files using the Rubber Duck Debugging method
0-main.c: Tests that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct ouput when given a case of 0.
1-main.c: Commented out the part of the code that was causing the file to go into an infinite loop.
2-largest_number.c: Fixed the code so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
3-print_remaining_days.c: Fixed the print_remaining_days() function so that the ouput works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
